 * Resolve an intra-op thread cap for the embedding session, or null to leave
 * onnxruntime at its default (one worker per core).
 *
 * Embedding is done one exchange at a time (batch=1) throughout indexing, sync,
 * and the re-embed migration. At that size onnxruntime-node's default intra-op
 * thread pool fans each tiny int8 matmul across every core, which on Apple
 * Silicon pegs ~5 cores for almost no throughput gain and makes a bulk re-embed
 * hog the whole machine. Capping intra-op threads keeps embedding off the
 * user's cores; measured on an M-series Mac, a cap of 2 is as fast or faster
 * than the uncapped default while using ~1.7 cores instead of ~5 (and pulls
 * further ahead when the machine is otherwise busy, since it stops the pool
 * from oversubscribing).
 *
 * This stays on the same CPU / q8 execution provider, so embeddings are
 * bit-identical to the uncapped output — no re-index is triggered. (CoreML and
 * WebGPU were evaluated and rejected: on this quantized model they either run
 * far slower and never leave the CPU, or require an fp32 model whose vectors
 * differ from the stored q8 ones and would force a full re-index.)
 *
 * Override with EPISODIC_MEMORY_EMBED_THREADS: a positive integer sets the cap;
 * 0 (or any non-positive/invalid value) restores onnxruntime's default.
